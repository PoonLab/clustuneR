Description: clustuneR builds clusters from inputted sequence alignments and/or 
    phylogenetic trees, allowing users to choose between multiple cluster-building 
    algorithms implememented in the package and tune clustering parameters to produce 
    informative clusters. The package also takes in meta-data associated with sequences 
    such as a known collection date or subtype/variant classification. Cluster-level 
    characteristics, such as the range of collection dates or the most common 
    subtype/variant within a cluster can also be identified from these. 
    If a subset of sequences are specified as "New", then clustuneR simulates cluster 
    growth by building clusters in two stages: first clusters are built from sequences 
    which are not specified as new, then the new sequences are added to clusters. 
    Predictive models can then be tested on cluster-level attributes and validated 
    with growth outcomes, to measure how informative a cluster set is.
