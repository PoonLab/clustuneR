#' Makes a graph object based on sequence data and pairwise comparisons
#'
#' Create an implementation of a graph. This is a list, consisting of a distance 
#' matrix and some sequence meta data (seq.info). Any new sequences are resolved
#' as growth ensuring that new sequences are added prospectively without merging 
#' clusters. Clusters containing purely new sequences are also ignored for this 
#' purpose. At this point, new sequences only connect to the closest non-new 
#' neighbour (although other options for growth resolutions may exist and be 
#' implemented).
#' 
#' @param seq.info: data.table, A set of sequence meta-data coupled to alignment header
#'                  Must contain a Header column of sequence labels
#' @param edge.info: matrix, A pairwise edge matrix of all associated headers in seq.info
#' @param which.new: integer, Which sequences in seq.info are "new". this is a list of indices.
#' @param growth.resolution: function, The method by which growth is resolved. This ensures 
#' new cases don't merge clusters. By default, each new sequence joins a cluster 
#' by only it's minimum retrospective edge. 
#' @return list, A compact representation of a graph, with sequences and edge info, 
#' as well as a growth resolution. 
#' See graph.ex for a more detailed example with annotated data.
